HEART-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND WARNING SIGNS

This document provides general educational information about common heart-related symptoms.
It is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

COMMON HEART SYMPTOMS

1. Chest Pain or Discomfort
Chest pain is one of the most common symptoms of heart problems.
It may feel like pressure, tightness, squeezing, heaviness, or burning in the chest.
Pain may spread to the arms, neck, jaw, back, or stomach.
Chest pain may worsen with physical activity or emotional stress.

2. Shortness of Breath
Difficulty breathing may occur during activity or while resting.
It can happen due to reduced blood flow or fluid buildup in the lungs.
Shortness of breath may be a sign of heart failure or coronary artery disease.

3. Palpitations
Palpitations are sensations of rapid, fluttering, or irregular heartbeats.
They may be caused by arrhythmias or stress-related heart conditions.
Occasional palpitations can be harmless, but frequent episodes should be evaluated.

4. Fatigue and Weakness
Persistent tiredness or lack of energy may indicate reduced heart efficiency.
Fatigue may worsen with physical activity and improve with rest.

5. Dizziness or Fainting
Lightheadedness or fainting can occur when the heart cannot pump enough blood to the brain.
This may be related to abnormal heart rhythms or low blood pressure.

6. Swelling (Edema)
Swelling in the legs, ankles, feet, or abdomen may indicate heart failure.
It occurs due to fluid retention when the heart pumps inefficiently.
